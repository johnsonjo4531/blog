Though I have finished the proof on paper I have not written up the explanation for it here!!!

## Background: 

I read a comment on Hacker News somewhat recently about
the general long division algorithm being unintuitive.
This guy stated his credentials and the comment after his
said surely he could come up with a proof in around 15-30 minutes,
so I like Math and I like to think I'm atleast somewhat good at it
for not being a mathematician, so I challenged myself to write up a proof.

## Justification for a proof

You might ask well why a proof, and I just have to say 
I feel a proof is the best way to see something intuitively.
Here is my attempt at proving the long division algorithm. 
If you notice any mistakes please let me know on twitter
or on a github issue on my blog or by any other means you 
can contact me with.

First I'll show an example of the long-division algorithm
the way I learned it in school. This is honestly what I first
wrote down to get the correct mental model of the algorithm.

### Example

So, first we will divide 128 by 5 just as an example.

<!-- https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/issues/1319#issuecomment-389753671 -->

We set up the equation:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;1}{} \\
5\overline{\smash{)}128} \\

\end{array}
$$

We first notice five doesn't go into 1 so we do our first division of five on 12 instead
five goes into 12 two times so we write two on top and subtract $2\times5$ or $10$:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;1}{2} \\
5\overline{\smash{)}128} \\
\phantom{}{-\underline{10}}
\end{array}
$$


that subtraction produces two:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;1}{2} \\
5\overline{\smash{)}128} \\
\phantom{}{-\underline{10}} \\
\phantom{-1}{2}
\end{array}
$$

Then we bring down the 8:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;1}{2} \\
5\overline{\smash{)}128} \\
\phantom{}{-\underline{10}\smash{\downarrow}} \\
\phantom{-1}{28}
\end{array}
$$

and repeat until we get:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;1}{25\frac{3}{5}} \\
5\overline{\smash{)}128\phantom{3}} \\
\phantom{}{-\underline{10}\smash{\downarrow}} \\
\phantom{-1}{28} \\
\phantom{1}{-\underline{25}} \\
\phantom{-12}{3}
\end{array}
$$

## Clearing up Some Hand-wavyness

So, there are some parts there that may seem a little mysterious and hand-wavy, so lets start by clearing those up.
First of all at this step where we subtract 10:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;1}{2} \\
5\overline{\smash{)}128} \\
\phantom{}{-\underline{10}}
\end{array}
$$

We are really or atleast can really divide 5 from 12, but you can think of it as we are dividing 5 from 120
and subtracting 100 which five goes into 100 twenty times.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\phantom{5;1}{20} \\
5\overline{\smash{)}128} \\
\phantom{}{-\underline{100}}

\end{array}
$$

This mental model will come in handy for our proof. For example notice that the right side of this equation is our result rewritten:
