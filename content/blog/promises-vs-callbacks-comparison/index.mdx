tldr: Promises have alot of interesting properties that make them
useful for wrapping a singular value at some given point in time
giving them some advantages over callbacks for async programming.

So you've heard about [promises][promises], well what's
the major advantage of them compared to callbacks.
It might seem there isn't any huge advantage to them
atleast at first glance but there are some properties of
promises that aren't true of atleast some or all callbacks.
Just having the guarentees that a Promise will always behave
the same in ways that a callback might not
makes promises a handy tool to use for single values that come
over a point in time.

1. A promise always has a .then that accepts a callback function.
2. A promise always has a .catch that accepts a callback function
   and acts like a `catch` block from a `try`/`catch`.
3. A promise always has a .finally which acts as a `finally` block
   from a `try`/`catch`/`finally`.
4. You can `await` a promise using async functions.
5. You have utilities builtin to JavaScript at your disposal when
   working with promises which at the moment are:

## 1. .then methods

`.then`

## 2. .catch methods

`catch` methods and error handling with Promises is probably its biggest
advantage over callbacks. So, how do you handle errors in callbacks.

```js code-example
function myCallbackTakingFunction(cb) {
  setTimeout(cb, 3000);
}
```

## 5. JavaScript Builtin Utilities

You have utilities builtin to JavaScript at your disposal when working with promises which at the moment are:

### Promise.all:

`Promise.all` allows you to await several Promises concurrently.
Notice how this means the below code executes in the time
of the longest timeout and not the addition of all the timeouts:

```js code-example
const timeout = ms => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, ms));
(async () => {
  const time = Date.now();
  await Promise.all([timeout(1000), timeout(3000), timeout(2500)]);
  console.log(`Executed in ${Date.now() - time}ms`);
})();
```

Which is as opposed to something like the following which runs sequentially. Notice
how the time this takes to complete is the sum of all timeouts.

```js code-example
const timeout = ms => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, ms));
(async () => {
  const time = Date.now();
  await timeout(1000);
  await timeout(3000);
  await timeout(2500);
  console.log(`Executed in ${Date.now() - time}ms`);
})();
```

- Promise.any
- Promise.race
- Promise.reject
- Promise.resolve
